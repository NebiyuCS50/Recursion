# ðŸ“˜ Algorithms: Merge Sort & Fibonacci (Recursion)

## ðŸ“Œ Overview

This project demonstrates two classic algorithms implemented in JavaScript:

1. Merge Sort â€“ a divide-and-conquer sorting algorithm.

2. Fibonacci (Recursion) â€“ computing Fibonacci numbers using recursion.

Both are great examples to understand recursion and divide-and-conquer techniques.

## ðŸ”¢ Fibonacci with Recursion

### âœ¨ What is Fibonacci?

The Fibonacci sequence is:

```bash
0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, ...

```

## ðŸ“Š Merge Sort

### âœ¨ What is Merge Sort?

- Divide and Conquer algorithm.

- Splits the array into halves until single elements remain.

- Merges them back in sorted order.

## ðŸ“š Learning Notes

- Recursion means a function calls itself until it hits a base case.

- Merge Sort shows how recursion can break down big problems into smaller ones.

- Fibonacci recursion is simpler, but less efficient for large n.
